The Network can currently predict only Letters A,B,C. The input is in the form of a 10x10 matrix where the higlighted pixels are 1 and non-highlighted pixels are -1. The program was already fed with a sample input which can be changed accordingly. The output looks like the following:
1) A

    XX    
    XX    
   XXXX   
   X  X   
  XX  XX  
  X    X  
 XXXXXXXX 
 XXXXXXXX 
XX      XX
X        X

2) B
